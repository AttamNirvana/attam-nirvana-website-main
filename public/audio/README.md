/* 
  Audio file placeholder - For the healing frequency audio
  
  To implement this properly:
  1. Download or generate a theta wave healing frequency audio (40 Hz is recommended)
  2. Convert to MP3 format (ideally 128kbps or lower for web optimization)
  3. Replace this file with the actual audio file
  
  Recommended resources:
  - Theta wave frequency: ~4-8 Hz or 40 Hz
  - File format: MP3 (web-optimized, loopable)
  - Duration: 5-10 minutes (will loop continuously)
  - Volume: Kept low by default (15%) in AudioToggle component
  
  Example free resources:
  - YouTube Audio Library
  - Pixabay Music
  - Freesound.org
  
  Once you have the audio file, rename it to 'healing-frequency.mp3' 
  and place it in the public/audio/ directory.
